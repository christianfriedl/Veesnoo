- id-0001 App quitting
    - in debug, ESC is good
    - "default" key: ctrl-c would actually be a rather good choice...
    - ... use:
            setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
            initscr();
            noecho();
            raw();
            keypad(stdscr, TRUE);
    - implement a ctrl-c/SIGINT handler
- reflect class hierarchy
    - merge Container into FocusableContainer?
- what does a mainwindow have to do?
    - it has to route receiveKey directly to its focused widget
    - it has to have a sep. focusmanager
    - it has to receive the request to set its focused widget
- where do we want to add subwidgets, which we cannot do in the constructor?
    - have a vector preparedSubWidgets, and add them all in a special method?
- what do we call a window that is a main app?
    - should we bind the app to a window?
    - where does the event loop live?
        - in the main window?
        - in a separate app, that has a window as a member... sounds good
        - App::window_
- additional basic textbox features
    - go to start
    - go to end
    - backspace
- remove bare pointers
    - Widget.h
    - FocusableContainer.h
    - FocusableWidget.h
    - Container.h
    - ContainerFocusManager.h
    - VerticalMenu.h
    - SingleFocusManager.h

    - CursesManager.h ? (WINDOW* needs to be a pointer...) --- Rect* not, though


- refactor toString to ostream& <<
- move to new realtime get*Rect()
- rename addCh to addChar

- add copy constructors and operator= everywhere
- addString, addCh etc: add only the portion that fits into contentRect
- finish textbox
    - extract key handler

- create event queue
    - boost::signals2 !!!
    - std::map<std::string, boost:signals2:sig>

- what events will we actually need?
    - Widget
        - should_refresh ???
    - KeyReceiving
        - before_keypress
        - after_keypress
    - Focusable
        - after_focus
        - after_blur
    - (Window etc) 
        - before_close
        - after_activate


- add interfaces to classes
    - KeyReceiving

- rename deFocus() to blur()

- FocusableWidget and FocusableContainer currently have a common 
interface but implement their focus... methods themselves, is this good?

- finalize widgets
    - PopupMenu
    - SelectBox
    - Window

- implement focus handling
- create an App class

-  add functionality to TextBox


- layout and sizing
    - remove pack()
    - class Size { int width; int height }
    - Widget member: minimumSize_
    - use Container's for layout control
    ---- HorizontalLayout
